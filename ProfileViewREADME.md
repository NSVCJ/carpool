Profile View Get Requests
---

There are 3 things the Profile View needs from the database

1. Info about trips where I'm a Rider
2. Info about trips where I'm a Driver
3. Toggle the confirmation status of your riders when you're a Driver

You need to specify a route for each get request

1. api/riderProfile
2. api/driverProfile
3. api/driverProfile

This guide will walk you through how to make each of those get requests.

1. Info about trips where I'm a Rider
---

*Use this address as your request url* <br>
**`req.url = localhost:<PORT>/api/riderProfile`** <br>
*You must pass in a params object containing your UserId. That information will be available from authentication.*
```javascript
params: {
  "UserId": "[ID]"
}
```
*Or you can pass in the params in the request url* <br>
**`req.url = localhost:<PORT>/api/riderProfile?UserId=<ID>`** <br>

*Test with UserId=1*

*In response, you will get an object that looks like this:*
```javascript
{
  {
    "confirmed": [
      {
        "TripId": 5,
        "pickupLocation": "1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW, Washington, DC 20500",

3. How to Toggle a Users confirmation status on the Driver Profile
---
*You need to make a PUT request to this URL*<br>
**`req.url = localhost:<PORT>/api/driverProfile`** <br>
*PUT requests from Rider Event page must send in data following this format* <br>
```javascript
{
  "TripId": "<ID>" //id from trip that driver clicked on
  "UserId" : "<ID>" //the id of the RIDER that the driver wants to toggle
}
```

*In response, you will get an object that looks like this:*
```javascript
{
  "updated": "Rider"
}
```
*or*
```javascript
{
  "updated": "Unconfirmed"
}
```
